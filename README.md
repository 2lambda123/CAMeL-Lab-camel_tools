# CAMeL Tools

![alt text](camel_logo.png "CAMeL logo")

## Introduction

A suite of morphological analysis and disambiguation tools for Arabic developed
by the
[CAMeL Lab](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-research/camel-lab.html)
at [New York University Abu Dhabi](http://nyuad.nyu.edu/).

## Installation

At the moment, CAMeL Tools can only be installed from source by following the
instructions below.

```bash
# Download the repo
git clone https://github.com/owo/camel_tools.git
cd camel_tools

# Install CAMeL Tools and all dependencies
pip install .
```

## Usage

CAMeL Tools are a set of command line interface (CLI) tools as well as a set
of Python libraries. This section will help you get started with both.

### CLI Tools

This section will list all the CLI tools that come bundled with CAMeL Tools and
will explain their usage.

#### camel_transliterate

The `camel_transliterate` tool allows you to transliterate text from one form
to another using one of the builtin transliteration schemes. It also allows
tokens to be prefixed with a marker to indicate that they should not be
transliterated.

Below is the usage information that can be generated by running
`camel_transliterate --help`.

```none
Usage:
    camel_transliterate (-s SCHEME | --scheme=SCHEME)
                        [-m MARKER | --marker=MARKER]
                        [-I | --ignore-markers]
                        [-S | --strip-markers]
                        [-o OUTPUT | --output=OUTPUT] [FILE]
    camel_transliterate (-l | --list)
    camel_transliterate (-v | --version)
    camel_transliterate (-h | --help)

Options:
  -s SCHEME --scheme          Scheme used for transliteration.
  -o OUTPUT --output=OUTPUT   Output file. If not specified, output will be
                              printed to stdout.
  -m MARKER --marker=MARKER   Marker used to prefix tokens not to be
                              transliterated. Set to '@@IGNORE@@' by default.
  -I --ignore-markers         Transliterate marked words as well.
  -S --strip-markers          Remove markers in output.
  -l --list                   Show a list of available transliteration schemes.
  -h --help                   Show this screen.
  -v --version                Show version.
```

Below is a list of currently available transliteration schemes.

```none
ar2bw            Arabic to Buckwalter
ar2safebw        Arabic to Safe Buckwalter
ar2xmlbw         Arabic to XML Buckwalter
ar2hsb           Arabic to Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter
bw2ar            Buckwalter to Arabic
bw2safebw        Buckwalter to Safe Buckwalter
bw2xmlbw         Buckwalter to XML Buckwalter
bw2hsb           Buckwalter to Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter
safebw2ar        Safe Buckwalter to Arabic
safebw2bw        Safe Buckwalter to Buckwalter
safebw2xmlbw     Safe Buckwalter to XML Buckwalter
safebw2hsb       Safe Buckwalter to Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter
xmlbw2ar         XML Buckwalter to Arabic
xmlbw2bw         XML Buckwalter to Buckwalter
xmlbw2safebw     XML Buckwalter to Safe Buckwalter
xmlbw2hsb        XML Buckwalter to Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter
hsb2ar           Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter to Arabic
hsb2bw           Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter to Buckwalter
hsb2safebw       Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter to Safe Buckwalter
hsb2xmlbw        Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter to Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter
```

##### Notes on markers

A marker a string with no whitespace characters at the beginning, middle, or
end of it (in otherwords, it's a single token without padding spaces). As a
rule-of-thumb pick a marker that is not-likely to appear in your text. We
use `@@IGNORE@@` as a default value, while some Arabic NLP tools use `@@LAT@@`
to denote latin/foreign text.

##### Notes on schemes

Below is a reference conversion table of Arabic to Buckwalter (BW), Safe
Buckwalter (Safe BW), XML Buckwalter (XML BW),
and Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter (HSB) transliteration schemes.

The transliteration schemes `ar2bw`, `ar2safebw`, `ar2xmlbw`, `ar2hsb`,
`bw2ar`, `bw2safebw`, `bw2xmlbw`, `bw2hsb`, `safebw2ar`, `safebw2bw`,
`safebw2xmlbw`, `safebw2hsb`, `xmlbw2ar`, `xmlbw2bw`, `xmlbw2safebw`,
`xmlbw2hsb`, `hsb2ar`, `hsb2bw`, `hsb2safebw`, `hsb2xmlbw`, and all use the
conversion table below for transliteration. Input characters not listed in the
table below are output as they appear without any transliteration.

#### camel_arclean

The `camel_arclean` utility cleans Arabic text by:

- Deleting characters that are not in Arabic, ASCII, or Latin-1.
- Converting all spacing characters to an ASCII space character.
- Converting Indic digits into Arabic digits.
- Converting extended Arabic letters into basic Arabic letters.
- Converting 1-char presentation froms into simple basic forms.

Below is the usage information that can be generated by running
`camel_arclean --help`.

```none
Usage:
    camel_arclean [-o OUTPUT | --output=OUTPUT] [FILE]
    camel_arclean (-v | --version)
    camel_arclean (-h | --help)

Options:
  -o OUTPUT --output=OUTPUT   Output file. If not specified, output will be
                              printed to stdout.
  -h --help                   Show this screen.
  -v --version                Show version.
```
